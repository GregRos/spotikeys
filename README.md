# spotikeys
This is an accidental framework. Sort of. Partially. The idea is to do AHK but in python. Some stuff tries to do this, but not very well. 

It has a UI system based on react, but overlayed on top of Tkinter, which is a cross-platform framework for native UI components.

It only supports windows right now due to a small number of things that had to be done via Win32 API calls.
